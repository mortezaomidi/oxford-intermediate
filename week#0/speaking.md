Somtimes even the cost of renting taxi changed. Many travelS may also be canceled.

    - Todays i'm reading Oxford skills book to improve my english skills. I got the e-book version of it. Based on preface of the book, it is standard book for learning english specificlly in vocabullary improvment. I like to read another book like it, but i think it is good practice to read it first an then read another book. I'm not finished it yet because we have just begun. My experience shown that i have rarely read a book completelly but i hop to finish it!
